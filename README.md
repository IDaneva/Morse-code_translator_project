# Morse code translator project
This is a simple project that I would like to further develop as I dive deeper into my coding learning path.
It is based on a exercise that I received as a part of the SoftUnni program. The main purpose is to translate morse text into plain one in English. 

When you run the program a new window pops up and requests a text to be entered

Once we have the text in morse that we want to translate we can just type it and click on the "Translate!" button.

For example if we take ".... . .-.. .-.. ---" the output will be then showed in the "Translation" field
